                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The South East Asian Institute of Technology, Inc. offers free education to all programs in college. The school is supported by different government sectors and NGOs.</p>
                
                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>South East Asian Institute of Technology, Inc. with its famous acronym SEAIT was formed like a drama with glaring spotlights in an amphitheater. The backdrops were up, the playwrights were ready, the actors and actresses well-dressed, the orchestra playing timeless music, and the curtain started to open… slowly.</p>
                
                <p>February 2006 marked the foundation of the dream school, not with the breaking ground but with the first cracking of the door in a literal sense. The school occupied a rented space at Shell Gasoline Station near Valera’s place, still in Tupi, catering to a minimal population of students who took up vocational courses.</p>

                <p>At first, SEAIT offered technical and vocational courses like Computer Programming NC IV and Computer Hardware Servicing NC II. The breakthrough came when SEAIT was granted by TESDA to offer Hotel and Restaurant Management. Later, CHED permitted the school to offer its first four-year science course, BS in Information Technology (BSIT), which successfully attracted students.</p>

                <p>The institution continued to expand, adding programs like Business Administration, Education, Criminology, Agriculture, and Civil Engineering. In 2016, it gained government recognition to operate the K-12 program, covering Kindergarten, Junior, and Senior High School.</p>
